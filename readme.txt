# ðŸ§Š Liquid Integration  

Hello! I'm **N1dza**, a DevOps engineer. ðŸš€
This project is a modified version of the **Hero of Time CPU integration**, now adapted for **Liquid Integration**.  

ðŸ”¹ **What does it do?**  
- Reads data from the pump.  
- Displays it on a monitor under the name "**Liquid**".  
- Code explanations are in ****Serbian**, while the output is in **English**..  

ðŸ”¹ **Why?**  
I wanted to enhance CPU integration and enable more precise monitoring of the liquid in the cooling system. ðŸ’§  

ðŸ›  **How to use it?**  
Everything you need is in the codeâ€”just follow the instructions and enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž
